# Data Analysis for Life Sciences 
This repository contains the materials for the course on Data Analysis for Life Sciences taught at Heidelberg university for the DSCB major.

## Preparations
1. Sign in to the Slack Workspace for this course
2. Complete the pre-course survey by *Friday Oct 27*
3. For the course you need to bring a laptop with the following installed:
	- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) - If you already have an existing installation of R, please make sure that your R version is 4.3.
	- [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)
  
	If you have problems with the installation, take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8F_wreHTzw) on how to install R and RStudio.

4. Once you have installed R and RStudio, please go to the [exercises](exercises/) page. There you will find two exercises to verify that everyone has a working R installation setup before the course and provides a recap on first steps in R. *Please take a look at both exercises before November 2 and hand in the output in via Slack (see details in the exercises)*

If you encounter any problems, get help via the Slack *#help* channel.
